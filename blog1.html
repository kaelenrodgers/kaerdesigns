                        <p class="ph">Hello all! For my blog I am doing type reviews, in which I pick a typeface and share about it. I’ll write a little bit about the history and creation of the typeface, what makes it distinct from other types, and how to best use it, including what it pairs with well.</p>
                        <p class="ph">For my first review, and my first post, we’re going to talk about Baskerville, my absolute favorite typeface. If it were a professionally sound decision, I would use it on everything, because let’s be honest.</p>
                        <p class="ph">It could work for everything.</p>    
                    <h2 class="subhead">History</h2>
                        <p class="ph">Baskerville was created by the English printer John Baskerville in the 1750s. Today, with personal laptops and constant internet access, even the most basic user can write in thousands of typefaces. If I wanted, I could probably put each letter of this post in a different font. But that is an modern development.
                        </p>
                        <p class="ph">In the days of John Baskerville, documents were printed by hand. Each letter was made as part of a small metal block called a slug. Those who owned a printing press would generally make their own letters to use in their projects. Baskerville, who grew up fascinated with calligraphy, bought his own printing press and made his own type accordingly.
                        </p>
                        <p>image</p>
                        <p class="ph">However, he was also a perfectionist. The first book he printed, Virgil’s The Aeneid, was known for its quality of the paper, ink color, binding, and, most importantly, type. As Baskerville continued his business, he also refined the metal letters he used for printing. He sought to create letters that would contain the same proportions of black and white, creating an evenly balanced page for the eye. He adjusted the modulation (the difference between the thick parts and the thin parts), and he thinned the serifs (the pointy parts on the ends of the letters).
                        </p>
                        <p class="ph">Baskerville also created a special italicized version of his typeface. Despite common belief, a true italic is not just any old typeface slanted to the side and squished together. Instead, great thought and care has gone into adjusting the original letterforms so that the italicized version is equally legible while taking up less space on a page.
                        </p>
                        <p class="ph">Baskerville’s traditionalist British audience was rather offended at all these adjustments made to the letterforms, but France was newly a republic, and they quickly adopted his typeface for their printing presses. And through France, so did America. 
                        </p>
                    <h2 class="subhead">Distinctives</h2>
                        <p class="ph">Baskerville (the typeface, not the guy) is known for its thin, almost sharp, serifs, and its natural modulation. It is considered a transitional typeface as it isn’t like the earliest traditional types, but it doesn’t reach the extremes of Didot and other more modern faces. That being said, with the coming of sanserif and geometrical typefaces, Baskerville has been relegated to the region of tradition and historicism. When used well, Baskerville gives off an even, balanced, and steady air. It is a typeface of elegance and grace while also being dependable.
                        </p>
                    <h2 class="subhead">Good Pairings</h2>
                        <p class="ph">There are two key elements that make a good typeface pairing: contrast and commonality. I know, that sounds like opposites, but it’s true. To pair well, both typefaces should have the same internal guide, the same general baseline of shape, otherwise they will clash like ice cream and ketchup. On the other hand, they do need to be different in some way, otherwise you might as well just use one. Below are some good pairings that I’ve found, but there are sure to be hundreds of others!

                        <p class="ph">That’s all I have for now. I’d love to hear what you know about Baskerville and what other typefaces pair well with it. Or give me some of your favorite typefaces! Note: I will have a comment box eventually, I’m just still working on setting it up.
