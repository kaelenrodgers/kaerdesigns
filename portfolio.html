                        <p class="ph">Baskerville was created by the English printer John Baskerville in the 1750s. Today, with personal laptops and constant internet access, even the most basic user can write in thousands of typefaces. If I wanted, I could probably put each letter of this post in a different font. But that is an modern development.

                        <p class="ph">However, he was also a perfectionist. The first book he printed, Virgil’s The Aeneid, was known for its quality of the paper, ink color, binding, and, most importantly, type. As Baskerville continued his business, he also refined the metal letters he used for printing. He sought to create letters that would contain the same proportions of black and white, creating an evenly balanced page for the eye. He adjusted the modulation (the difference between the thick parts and the thin parts), and he thinned the serifs (the pointy parts on the ends of the letters).
