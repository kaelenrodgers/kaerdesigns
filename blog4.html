                        <h1 class="title">Indy Pop</h1>
                        <p class="ph">Hello May! This month I’m finishing up a large design project, so I thought I’d share. As you might have seen on my Instagram, I’ve spent this past semester creating a brand for a small soda company. My classmates and I have made names, designed logos, made physical packaging, and created advertisements. It’s been an intense but rewarding process, so I wanted to share how Indy Pop has come to be.</p>
                    
                        
                    <h2 class="subhead">Why Indy Pop</h2>
                        <p class="ph">I wanted to hone in on local young adults and families so the brand constructs I’ve been building off of are simplicity and fun. I chose bright colors on a clean white background and the reoccurring theme of bubbles to convey that idea of fun but stuck to flat colors rather than gradients or tiny details to continue the simplicity. Locality is also important to this brand, which is reflected mainly in name: “Indy Pop.” 
                        </p>
                        
                        <img src="imagesb/indypoplogo.jpg" class="imagesw">
                        
                    <h2 class="subhead">The Process</h2>
                        <p class="ph">The first step of the actual design process was creating a logo. I chose a wordmark, pictured above. I chose blue, orange, and red for their vivid yet happy appearance. The rounded edges and flat color reflect simplicity while still being fun. Finally, the dot of the I and under the y/exclamation point are hollowed out as an echo of soda’s bubbles
                        </p>
                        <img src="imagesb/indypopstationary.jpg" class="imagesw">
                        
                        <p class="ph">With the logo finished, we moved onto stationary: business cards, letterheads, and envelopes. Most people find this stage boring, but I really enjoyed thinking through the best way to make these objects function yet exciting. I expanded the bubbles of the logo into a trail that continues across the rest of the brand, providing a simple harmony that injects energy and vibrant colors. One final element of the stationery and brand that I love is the looping of the bubble trails as seen on the envelope and matching of the business cards. This gives Indy Pop a sense of endlessness, that fun will never end.
                        </p>
                        
                        <img src="imagesb/indypopcard2.png" class="imagesw">
                        
                        
                        <p class="ph">The bottle packaging for Indy Pop continues the bubble stream motif through the trails around the outside of the carrier and climbing up the bottle. I chose a glass soda bottle for its classic and simple look, painted white (coming soon) to control the background so the bubbles and logo pop as they are supposed to. Indy Pop sodas could be sold as individuals or in 4 packs. The carrier for the 4pack will be made of white poster/cardboard is it is a sturdy material that can be recycled. (And if you look on the inside, it’s covered in bubbles!)</p>
                        <p class="ph">The final stage of this project was to create an advertisement for our new brand. In classic Indy Pop style, I went all out with the bubbles. I created a magazine ad that engages the audience of local families and adults through the sheer number of bubbles present, which in turns draws the eye towards the white space with Indy Pop’s logo.
                        </p>
                        <p class="ph">However, I wanted to create more than a static magazine ad when the bubbles provide so much opportunity for movement. I’m currently working on an animated video add. It starts out white and fills with bubbles, which will catch the viewer’s attention through the pops of color and movement. The bubbles appear faster and faster until the screen is filled with the exception of the bottle’s white silhouette, like the magazine ad. This part of the project has been complicated, as I’m dealing with somewhere over 2,000 bubbles, but I can’t wait to get all the problems sorted out!</p>
                        <img src="imagesb/indypop.jpg" class="imagesw">
                        <p class="ph">In the end, Indy Pop is a fun yet simple branding, notable for its continuous bubble themes in blue, oranges, and reds, that make it instantly recognizable. I’ve enjoyed the freedom present in the class, although at times all of the options have been overwhelming. Once I settled on a logo and the bubble motif, I was able to explode creativity all over the assignments (hence all the bubbles).
