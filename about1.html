                        <p class="aboutph">I’m Kaelen Rodgers, and I am a graphic designer and writer with a love of typography and layouts. My creative experience has given me a deep love for studying the way that culture, literature, and art influence each other. I primarily work in Adobe Suite and Microsoft Office, but love dabbling in other mediums, like photography, programing, and animation.</p>
                        <p class="aboutph">My professional design work includes work for the Missouri Botanical Gardens, Parnassus literary journal, Birrama Creative, and the Taylor University Writing Center. There has been a wide variety in these assignments from art direction, posters, and stickers to book layout, large scale banners, and t-shirt designs.</p>
                        
                        <p class="aboutph">I recently moved to New York City to pursue an MFA at Pratt Insitute, and I've quickly come to love the vibrant, busy city life. I hope to gain experience working with a design agency or creative firm during my time here and dream of someday being a college professor teaching graphic design. </p>
                        
                        <p class="aboutph">When I’m not making art or writing, I love traveling. I have been all across the United States, lived in England for two years, and spent a month studying culture in Central Asia. Someday I'd love to visit Iceland, but I have a few other trips planned first.
                        </p>
                        <p class="aboutph">Also, I love chocolate.
