                        <p class="aboutph">I’m Kaelen Rodgers, and I am a graphic designer and writer looking to gain more experience in typography and layouts. My creative experience has given me a deep love for studying the way that culture, literature, and art influence each other. I am comfortable in Adobe Suite, Microsoft Office. Thanks to being a quick learner, I’ve also been able to pick up photography and programing in html and css.</p>
                        <p class="aboutph">My freelance design work includes work for Taylor University’s Equestrian Team, Writing Center, and Honors Guild; Hugh O’Brian Youth Leadership; and Parnassus, Taylor University’s annual literary journal. There was a wide variety in these assignments from poster and stickers to book layout and t-shirt designs. My writing has been published in Aboite Independent, the Evangelical Church Library Association, Writer's Digest, and Parnassus.</p>
                        <p class="aboutph">I have also spent time in leadership as a college First Year Experience (FYE) group leader and then as a cabinet member in charge of the FYE group leaders. I am currently a tutor at my college's writing center and was recently requested to return as a FYE cabinet member.</p>
                        <p class="aboutph">When I’m not making art or writing, I love traveling. I have been all across the United States, lived in England for two years, and just spent a month studying culture in Asia.
                        </p>
                        <p class="aboutph">I also love chocolate.
