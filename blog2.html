                        <h1 class="title">Art in the Church</h1>
                        <p class="ph">Happy March! The sun is streaming in through my window, the wind is whipping around the corners of the building, and Indiana can’t decide if it’s spring or not. But in the meantime, I’ve been reading and thought I’d share my thoughts with you. </p>
                        <p class="ph">I just finished Imagine: A Vision for Christians in the Arts, by Steve Turner, in which he addresses how artists, writers, and musicians can approach their faith.</p>
                        <p class="ph">He begins his book by setting the stage of the world and the Christian church. There are a lot of reasons art and the modern church aren’t on best terms, some of which come from our Puritanical background, and some from the hierarchy of professions with preachers first, practical workers second, and everyone else last. Turner continues by analyzing the ways and reasons art, film, and literature are so influential in wider culture: because they speak to the deep pains of the world and hope of restoration, even if not in Christian terms. Finally, he addresses what we as Christians are to do with our artistic skill.</p>    
                        <p class="ph">I appreciated the way that Turner started with history, setting the stage for his discussion rather than jumping straight to the problem. He took what could quickly become a divisive topic (and has been across history, hello Iconoclastic controversy) and thoughtfully analyzed where modern culture stands on the issue. He put words to a lot of things I have been thinking about as I pursue my own career in the arts.
                        </p>
                        <p class="ph">I know art is important, but how does that affect the church?
                        </p>

                        <p class="ph">The thing is, a lot of Modern Christians are missing out on a way to know God deeper. If you find yourself in any evangelical church in America, chances are high that the walls are an empty beige. There might be an accent wall with exposed brick if you’re lucky. However, the moment you steep outside the church, you will be surrounded by bursts of green leaves and blue skies, a lush jungle of color and contrast and form. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="ph">I don’t have a problem with beige; it’s actually a nice color. But why are the walls empty? Surely there is at least one artist in the church that could use his gifts to beautify the building. I have heard art denied from places of worship on the grounds that it is distracting, or that we shouldn’t presume to make images of Biblical stories when we weren’t there.
                        </p>
                        <p class="ph">However, across the centuries the Church has used art to bring its members closer to God. By reflecting on the beauty of an orchard, we are reminded of how our Father provides; by gazing on the enormity of the mountains, we are reminded of the power of our King. By seeing the fragility of an infant, we are reminded of the sacrifice our Savior made. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="ph">Much like the fake plants in a church office, it’s easy to settle for the simple answer of avoiding the question. But as Christians made in the image of a creative God we are called to reflect His beauty and depth in all that we do. God has never called his people to the easy answer.
